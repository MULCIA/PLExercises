# PLExercises1

First block of exercises of Prolog for Logic Programming

## Exercise 1

Consists of building a small Prolog file that counts ocurrences of a number sorted array (list in Prolog) with duplicates from a number provided.

*Inputs:

´[2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]´

´target = 5´

*Output:

´Element 5 occurs 3 times.´

## Exercise 2

Consists of building a small Prolog file that search a given number in a nearly sorted array (list in Prolog) in O(logn) time.

*Inputs:

´[2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 9]´

´target = 5´

*Output:

´Element 5 founds at index 3.´
